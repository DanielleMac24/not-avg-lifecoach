## Getting Started

## Project Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Your Average Life Coach is a chat bot capable of holding sustained conversations and responding differently depending on your input. The goal of the bot is to give you life advice. The advice is poor by design. The user plays the role of someone in need of advice, help, or just someone wanting to have a general conversation. The bot will reply in the most disingenuous way it can, often giving the opposite of what's needed. The bot can be passive agressive or simply rude, and will never give real advice beyond the occasional unhelpful adage.
